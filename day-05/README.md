# Day 05 – Object-Oriented Python for DevOps (Basics)

## Task

Today’s goal is to **introduce Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in a simple and practical way.

You will take your **Day 04 Log Analyzer** script and refactor it using a **class-based approach**.

You will:
- Create a class to represent a Log Analyzer
- Move related logic into class methods
- Instantiate the class and run the analysis
- Keep the implementation simple and readable

This task helps you understand how DevOps tools are structured internally.


## Expected Output

- One Python script (example: `log_analyzer_oop.py`)
- Script should:
  - Use a class
  - Have at least 2–3 methods
  - Produce the same output as Day 04
- Output visible in terminal (and file if you choose)


## Guidelines

- Use:
  - `class` to group related logic
  - `__init__()` to initialize values (log file path, counters, etc.)
  - Instance methods for operations (read logs, analyze logs, write summary)
- Keep OOP **light and practical**
- Do NOT use:
  - Inheritance
  - Abstract classes
  - Advanced OOP patterns
- Follow PEP8 and Python best practices


## Resources

- Python classes and objects:
  https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html

- When to use OOP (read selectively):
  https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/

- PEP8 – Python Style Guide:
  https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/

- Your Day 04 Log Analyzer script


## Why This Matters for DevOps

In real DevOps work:
- Automation scripts grow into tools
- Tools need structure to stay maintainable
- OOP helps group logic, state, and behavior together

Most internal DevOps tools and platforms are written using **simple, practical OOP**, not complex theory.


## Submission

1. Add your OOP-based script inside the `day-05` folder
2. Ensure the script runs successfully
3. Verify output matches Day 04 behavior
4. Commit and push your changes to your fork


## Learn in Public

Share your progress on LinkedIn:
- Post a small snippet showing your class definition
- Mention how OOP improved code structure
- Write 2–3 lines on what you learned today

Optional:
- Tag **TrainWithShubham** or **Shubham Londhe**
- Use hashtags: `#PythonForDevOps #TrainWithShubham #DevOpsKaJosh` (Helps me to filter and engage)
