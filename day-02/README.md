# Day 02 – Automating System Tasks with Python

## Task

Today’s goal is to use **Python to interact with APIs and work with JSON data**.

You will create a Python script that:
- Calls a **public API** (example: GitHub API, JSONPlaceholder) [list](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)
- Fetches data using the `requests` library
- Parses the JSON response
- Extracts meaningful information from the response
- Prints the processed output to the **terminal**
- Saves the processed data into a **JSON file**

This task helps you understand how DevOps engineers work with APIs and structured data.


## Expected Output

- One Python script (example: `api_data_fetcher.py`)
- One JSON output file (example: `output.json`)
- Output should be visible:
  - In terminal
  - In the JSON file


## Guidelines

- Use:
  - `requests` library to call APIs
  - `.json()` to parse API responses
  - Dictionaries and lists to extract data
  - Functions to keep the code clean
- API can be:
  - GitHub public API  
  - JSONPlaceholder API  
- Keep the script simple and readable
- CLI arguments are optional (bonus)


## Resources

- Python `requests` documentation: https://docs.python-requests.org/
- JSONPlaceholder API: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
- GitHub REST API (public): https://docs.github.com/en/rest
- Python JSON basics (from live class)


## Why This Matters for DevOps

Modern DevOps work is **API-driven**:
- Cloud platforms
- Kubernetes
- Monitoring tools
- CI/CD systems

Understanding how to call APIs and parse JSON responses is a **core DevOps skill**.


## Submission

1. Fork the repository
2. Add your script inside the `day-02` folder
3. Ensure the script runs successfully
4. Confirm that the JSON output file is generated
5. Commit and push your changes to your fork


## Learn in Public

Share your progress on LinkedIn:
- Post a small code snippet showing API call or JSON parsing
- Share the output (terminal or JSON file)
- Write 2–3 lines on what you learned today (blog article is also fine)

Optional:
- Tag **TrainWithShubham** or **Shubham Londhe**
- Use hashtags: `#PythonForDevOps #TrainWithShubham #DevOpsKaJosh` (Helps me to filter post and Like/ Comment / Repost / engage)
