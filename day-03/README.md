# Day 03 – Strengthening Python Fundamentals for DevOps

## Task

Today’s goal is to **improve and refine your existing Python scripts** using better structure and basic error handling.

You will take **any one script** from:
- Day 01 (System Health Script), or
- Day 02 (API & JSON Script)

And enhance it by:
- Organizing the code into **functions**
- Adding **basic exception handling** (`try / except`)
- Improving variable names and readability
- Ensuring the script does not crash on common errors

This task focuses on writing **cleaner and safer Python code**, which is critical for DevOps automation.


## Expected Output

- One improved Python script
- Script should:
  - Run without crashing
  - Handle at least one error gracefully
- Output should be visible in terminal



## Guidelines

- Use:
  - `try / except` for error handling
  - Functions to separate logic
- Example errors to handle:
  - Invalid user input
  - API request failure
  - File not found
- Follow basic Python coding standards (PEP8)
- Do not rewrite everything from scratch
- Focus on **improving existing code**



## Resources

- Python exception handling:  
  https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html

- PEP8 – Python Style Guide (must read):  
  https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/

- Python Best Practices (read selectively):  
  https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/style/

- Refactoring basics (from live class)
- Your Day 01 / Day 02 scripts


## Why This Matters for DevOps

In real-world DevOps:
- Scripts run in production
- Failures are common (network, permissions, input errors)
- Code is often read and modified by others

Following PEP8 and best practices makes your automation:
- Easier to debug
- Easier to maintain
- Safer to run in production environments


## Submission

1. Update your existing scripts from `day-01` and `day-02` and update it inside the `day-03` folder
2. Ensure the script runs successfully
3. Commit and push your changes to your fork


## Learn in Public

Share your progress on LinkedIn:
- Post a small code snippet showing improved structure or error handling
- Mention how you applied PEP8 or best practices
- Write 2–3 lines on what you learned today

Optional:
- Tag **TrainWithShubham** or **Shubham Londhe**
