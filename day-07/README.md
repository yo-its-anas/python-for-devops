# Day 07 – Thinking Before Coding (DevOps Mindset)

## Task

Today’s goal is **NOT to write code**.

Today you will learn **how to think before writing automation code**.

Instead of directly opening VS Code and writing Python, you will:
- Pick **one script** you already wrote (Day 01 to Day 06)
- Understand what problem that script is solving
- Write down:
  - What is the problem?
  - What input does it need?
  - What output should it give?
  - What steps are involved?

This day is about **clear thinking**, not coding.


## Expected Output

- One simple text or markdown file (example: `design.md`)
- This file should answer:
  - What problem am I solving?
  - What input does my script need?
  - What output should my script give?
  - What are the main steps?

No code required today.


## Guidelines

- Use **simple language**
- Bullet points are enough
- You can write in:
  - Plain English
  - Or simple Hinglish
- Think like:
  - “User kya dega?”
  - “Script kya karega?”
  - “Output kaisa dikhega?”

This is **planning**, not programming.


## Resources

- Your own scripts from Day 01 to Day 06
- Notes from live classes
- No new concepts today


## Why This Matters for DevOps

In real DevOps work:
- Direct coding without thinking causes bugs
- Bad automation breaks in production
- Teams expect you to explain your logic clearly

Good DevOps engineers **plan first, then automate**.


## Submission

1. Create a file inside the `day-07` folder (example: `design.md`)
2. Write your plan clearly
3. Commit and push your changes to your fork


## Learn in Public

Share your progress on LinkedIn:
- Write 2–3 lines on what you planned today
- Mention how planning helps before coding
- Screenshot of your design file is optional

Optional:
- Tag **TrainWithShubham** or **Shubham Londhe**
- Use hashtags: `#PythonForDevOps #TrainWithShubham #DevOpsKaJosh` (Helps me to filter post and Like/ Comment / Repost / engage)
